"""
AES in ECB mode
The Base64-encoded content in this file has been encrypted via AES-128 in ECB mode under the key

"YELLOW SUBMARINE".
(case-sensitive, without the quotes; exactly 16 characters; I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because
it's exactly 16 bytes long, and now you do too).

Decrypt it. You know the key, after all.

Easiest way: use OpenSSL::Cipher and give it AES-128-ECB as the cipher.

Do this with code.
You can obviously decrypt this using the OpenSSL command-line tool, but we're having you get
ECB working in code for a reason. You'll need it a lot later on, and not just for attacking ECB.

        I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell

        For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
        Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
        I'm an effect and that you can bet
        I can take a fly girl and make her wet.

        There's no denyin', You can try to hang
        But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
        Over and over, practice makes perfect
        But not if you're a loafer.

        You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
        Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
        Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

        You might have it
        So step down and lend me your ear
        '89 in my time! You, '90 is my year.

        You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
        Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
        So don't be mad and don't be sad
        'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
        You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
        Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
        So come up close and don't be square
